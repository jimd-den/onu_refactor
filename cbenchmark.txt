Performance Comparison (C vs. Onu - Fibonacci 40)
--------------------------------------------------
C (compiled with GCC -O3):
Execution Time: 0.315s

Onu (compiled with the new native backend, using -O3 optimization):
Execution Time: 0.528s

Note: The C version is slightly faster, but Onu's output performs exceptionally well now that we've enabled `-O3` optimizations using LLVM in `lib.rs` (0.528s vs 1.886s previously). The generated executable functions correctly.
