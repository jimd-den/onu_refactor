the module called RecursionVerification
    with concern: tail call optimization

-- Deep recursion to test TCO
the effect behavior called count-down
    with intent: demonstrate deep tail recursion
    takes:
        an integer called n
    delivers: nothing
    with diminishing: n
    as:
        if n matches 0
            then derivation: d1 derives-from nothing broadcasts "PASS: Deep recursion complete."
            else (n decreased-by 1) utilizes count-down

the effect behavior called run
    with intent: verify tail call optimization
    takes: nothing
    delivers: nothing
    as:
        -- If TCO is broken, 100,000 might blow the stack or hang
        100000 utilizes count-down
        nothing
