the module called LogicVerification
    with concern: operation correctness

the effect behavior called run
    with intent: verify binary operations and logic
    takes: nothing
    delivers: nothing
    as:
        -- Verify NotEqual mapping (previously Eq bug)
        derivation: a derives-from 1
        derivation: b derives-from 2
        derivation: is-diff derives-from a opposes b
        
        if is-diff matches 1
            then derivation: d1 derives-from nothing broadcasts "PASS: 1 opposes 2 is TRUE (1)"
            else derivation: d2 derives-from nothing broadcasts "FAIL: 1 opposes 2 is FALSE (0)"
            
        derivation: is-same derives-from a opposes a
        if is-same matches 0
            then derivation: d3 derives-from nothing broadcasts "PASS: 1 opposes 1 is FALSE (0)"
            else derivation: d4 derives-from nothing broadcasts "FAIL: 1 opposes 1 is TRUE (1)"
            
        nothing
